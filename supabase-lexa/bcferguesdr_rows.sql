pergunta principal: Fiquei afastado mais de 15 dias e a empresa não pagou. O que fazer?
perguntas relacionadas: Quem paga após 15 dias?


A empresa é responsável?


Devo procurar o INSS?


Posso processar a empresa?


Como regularizar o pagamento?

pergunta principal: Meu médico disse que não posso mais trabalhar. Isso já garante aposentadoria?
perguntas relacionadas: Estou incapaz, já posso me aposentar por invalidez?


O laudo médico é suficiente?


Preciso ter tempo de contribuição?


Como o INSS avalia incapacidade?


O que falta para o pedido dar certo?
resposta: O laudo é um passo importante, mas o INSS também analisa histórico de contribuições e períodos trabalhados. A gente confere tudo (laudos + CNIS) e monta o pedido mais forte possível.

pergunta principal: Posso pagar INSS em atraso para completar tempo?
perguntas relacionadas: Dá pra recolher retroativo?


Como faço o pagamento em atraso?


Vale a pena pagar as contribuições em atraso?


Quais categorias permitem esse recolhimento?


Isso resolve minha situação?

pergunta principal: Contribuí em mais de um emprego ao mesmo tempo. Isso ajuda?
perguntas relacionadas: INSS soma contribuições em duplicidade?


Trabalhei em dois empregos, conta tudo?


Isso aumenta o valor da aposentadoria?


Como é feito o cálculo?


Posso aproveitar vínculos simultâneos?
resposta: Sim. O INSS soma contribuições simultâneas, o que pode aumentar o valor da aposentadoria. A gente confere o CNIS e faz o cálculo correto.
